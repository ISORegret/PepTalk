# How to Install PepTalk on Your iPhone

Follow these steps to add PepTalk to your home screen so it opens like an app.

---

## What you need

- Your iPhone
- The link to PepTalk (the web address you were sent — e.g. `https://yoursite.com/PepTalk/` or similar)
- A connection to the internet (Wi‑Fi or cellular)

---

## Steps

1. **Open the link in Safari**  
   Tap the PepTalk link you were sent.  
   Make sure it opens in **Safari** (Apple’s browser), not Chrome or another app.  
   If it opened elsewhere, copy the link and paste it into Safari’s address bar.

2. **Open the Share menu**  
   Tap the **Share** button at the bottom of the screen (square with an arrow pointing up).

3. **Add to Home Screen**  
   Scroll down in the Share menu and tap **“Add to Home Screen”**.

4. **Confirm**  
   You can leave the name as “PepTalk” or change it if you like.  
   Tap **“Add”** in the top-right corner.

5. **Done**  
   You’ll see the PepTalk icon on your home screen.  
   Tap it anytime to open PepTalk like a normal app.  
   Your data is stored on your device.

## Tips

- Use **Safari** to add it. “Add to Home Screen” may not appear in other browsers.
- The first time you open it from the home screen, you may need internet. After that it can work offline for things you’ve already loaded.
- To remove it later: press and hold the PepTalk icon, then choose **“Remove App”** → **“Remove from Home Screen”**. Your data in Safari may still be there until you clear site data in Settings.

*If the link doesn’t open or “Add to Home Screen” doesn’t appear, try again in Safari and make sure you’re using the exact link you were sent.*
