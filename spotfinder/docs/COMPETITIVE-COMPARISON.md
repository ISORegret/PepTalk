# SpotFinder vs. Photography & Photo-Spot Apps

A comparison of SpotFinder with the main photography location and photo-spot apps, based on public features and positioning.

---

## 1. Who’s in the same space?

| Category | Apps |
|----------|------|
| **Photo spot / location finders** | Atlas Photo, PhotoHound, LensScape, Explorest, PIXEO, Locationscout |
| **Photography planning (sun/moon)** | PhotoPills (golden hour, blue hour, Milky Way, etc.) |
| **Car / automotive photo spots** | PIXEO, Locationscout (often cited by car photographers); SpotFinder’s garage/industrial/graffiti types target this |

SpotFinder overlaps most with **Atlas Photo**, **PhotoHound**, **PIXEO**, and **Locationscout** (discovery + tips + map). **PhotoPills** is planning/timing-first; **LensScape** and **Explorest** are production/curation-focused.

## 3. What users often ask for (from reviews & communities)

| Request | Why it matters |
|--------|-----------------|
| **“Best time” at a glance** | Sunrise/sunset or golden hour per spot without opening another app. |
| **Parking & access** | Especially for car photographers and remote spots. |
| **Real photos from others** | See conditions and angles; SpotFinder’s “more photos + notes” aligns. |
| **Filters by type** | Landscape, urban, garage, etc.; “car spots” is a differentiator. |
| **Offline / no login** | Privacy and use in areas with bad connectivity. |
| **Favorites / lists** | Save spots and build trips; most competitors have this. |
| **Weather at location** | PhotoHound, Atlas, LensScape; often premium. |
| **Sun position / shadow sim** | Atlas, PhotoPills, LensScape; planning-heavy. |

## 4. Where SpotFinder fits

**SpotFinder today**

- **Curated spots** (built-in list) + **user-created spots** (saved on device).
- **Map** with all spots; **For You** feed with filters (All, Car spots, Urban, Garage, etc.).
- **Detail screen**: name, best time, address, parking, tips, GPS, main photo + **extra photos with notes** from others.
- **Creator-only edit** for user spots; **dark/light theme**; **safe-area** header on For You.
- **No account, no backend**: everything user-added is local.

**Vs. big catalog apps (PhotoHound, Locationscout, PIXEO, LensScape)**

- They win on **scale** (50K–260K+ spots) and **community**, plus **weather**, **sun/moon**, **collections**, **trip planning**.
- SpotFinder wins on **simplicity**, **local-first**, **no signup**, **automotive-oriented filters**, **edit-your-spot**, and **notes on contributed photos**.

**Vs. Atlas Photo**

- Atlas adds **AI-style recommendations**, **lighting simulation**, **“For you” feed**, **subscription**.
- SpotFinder is **free**, **local**, and **focused**: map + feed + filters + tips + parking + your spots and contributions.

**Vs. PhotoPills**

- PhotoPills is **planning-first** (golden hour, blue hour, Milky Way, sun/moon, calculators).
- SpotFinder is **spot-first** (where to shoot + best time text + parking + tips). They’re complementary; SpotFinder doesn’t replace PhotoPills for sun/moon timing.

## 5. Gaps vs. competitors (by impact)

**High impact / frequently requested**

1. **Favorites / saved spots** — Save spots to a list (and optionally “want to go” vs “done”).  
2. **Sunrise/sunset or golden hour at spot** — Either simple rise/set times per spot or link to system/PhotoPills.  
3. **Search** — By name, city, or tag so users don’t rely only on map and filters.

**Medium impact**

4. **Weather at spot** — Even a simple “current + 1–2 days” would match part of PhotoHound/Atlas.  
5. **Collections / trip lists** — e.g. “Weekend in Big Sur” with multiple spots.  
6. **More curated spots or import** — Expand built-in list or allow import (e.g. JSON/backup).  
7. **Directions** — Open in Maps with one tap (you have coords; deep link to Google/Apple Maps).

**Nice to have**

8. **Lighting preview** — Sun direction or simple shadow hint (Atlas/PhotoPills style).  
9. **EXIF on contributed photos** — Optional for contributors.  
10. **Optional cloud backup** — Account + sync for “my spots” across devices.

## 6. What SpotFinder does better or differently

- **No account, local-first** — User spots and contributions stay on device; good for privacy and offline.  
- **Edit your own spot** — Creators can fix address, parking, tips, photo; many apps don’t allow editing.  
- **Notes on contributed photos** — Each extra photo can have a caption/note from the contributor.  
- **“Car spots” + automotive types** — Garage, industrial, graffiti, beach, etc., in one filter.  
- **Dark theme** — Full light/dark with persisted preference.  
- **Free** — No subscription; different positioning from Atlas, PhotoHound, LensScape.  
- **Simple flow** — Add spot (including from map long-press), edit, add photo + note; no social layer.

## 7. Suggested next steps (prioritized)

1. **Favorites / saved list** — “Save” on detail screen; “Saved” filter or tab.  
2. **Directions** — “Open in Maps” using `latitude, longitude` (Google Maps / Apple Maps deep link).  
3. **Sunrise/sunset at spot** — Use device location + spot coords and a small lib (e.g. suncalc) to show “Sunrise 6:42, Sunset 7:08” (or “Golden hour ~6:00–7:30”) on detail.  
4. **Search** — By spot name or address (client-side on `allSpots` is enough for v1).  
5. **Weather** — Optional: one API (e.g. Open-Meteo) for current + 1 day at spot coords.  
6. **Collections / trips** — Named lists of spots (e.g. “PCH weekend”); stored locally like user spots.
